These comments are problems I have while developing the App

Feature: Date from Backend

I want to implement the date from the backend and allow make it so that when a user submits their post it:
    A) only allows one post a day
    B) displays a boolean: if true you can post today, if false then you can't post until the next day based on when you submitted the first post

Still having trouble with the Auth Loading Component since I need App to be a class to call in my backend data. Not sure if there is a way to make authO work when App is a class or if I can make another higher component to call in my data. Going to make PostContainer a class and do the fetch call there.

const App = () => {
// const { isLoading } = useAuth0();

  // if (isLoading) {
  //   return <Loading />;
  // }
  // return(
      ...
  )

}

// removing all of Auth-O and fixing favicon
// Need to get this up and running and I don't think spending a lot of time on figuring out Auth-O is productive as much as getting a functioning app running
